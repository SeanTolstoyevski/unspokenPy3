<h1>NVDA Add-on Scons Template</h1>
<p>This package contains a basic template structure for NVDA add-on development, building, distribution and localization.
For details about NVDA add-on development please see the <a href="http://www.nvda-project.org/documentation/developerGuide.html">NVDA Developer Guide</a>.
The NVDA addon development/discussion list <a href="http://www.freelists.org/list/nvda-addons">is here</a></p>
<p>Copyright (C) 2012-2013 nvda addon team contributors.</p>
<p>This package is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later. Please see the file COPYING.txt for further details.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>This template provides the following features you can use to help NVDA add-on development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic add-on package creation, with naming and version loaded from a centralized build variables file (buildVars.py).</li>
<li>Manifest file creation using a template (manifest.ini.tpl). Build variables are replaced on this template.</li>
<li>Compilation of gettext mo files before distribution, when needed.</li>
<li>To generate a gettext pot file, please run scons pot. A <strong>addon-name.pot</strong> file will be created with all gettext messages for your add-on. You need to check the buildVars.i18nSources variable to comply with your requirements.</li>
<li>Automatic generation of manifest localization files directly from gettext po files. Please make sure buildVars.py is included in i18nFiles.</li>
<li>Automatic generation of HTML documents from markdown (.md) files, to manage documentation in different languages.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>You need the following software to use this code for your NVDA add-ons development:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Python distribution (2.7 or greater is recommended). Check the <a href="http://www.python.org">Python Website</a> for Windows Installers.</li>
<li>Scons - <a href="http://www.scons.org/">Website</a> - version 2.1.0 or greater. Install it using <strong>easy_install</strong> or grab an windows installer from the website.</li>
<li>GNU Gettext tools, if you want to have localization support for your add-on - Recommended. Any Linux distro or cygwin have those installed. You can find windows builds <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/gettext.php">here</a>.</li>
<li>Markdown-2.0.1 or greater, if you want to convert documentation files to HTML documents. You can <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown/2.0.1">Download Markdown-2.0.1 installer for Windows</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>To create a new NVDA add-on, taking advantage of this template:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create an empty folder to hold the files for your add-on.</li>
<li>Copy the <strong>addon</strong> folder, the <strong>buildVars.py</strong> file, the manifest.ini.tpl file, the manifest-translated.ini.tpl, <strong>SCONSTRUCT</strong>, .gitignore and .gitattributes files to the created folder.</li>
<li>In the <strong>buildVars.py</strong> file, change variable <strong>addon_info</strong> with your add-on's information (name, summary, description, version, author and url).</li>
<li>Put your code in the usual folders for NVDA extension, under the <strong>addon</strong> folder. For instance: globalPlugins, synthDrivers, etc. You can delete folders you don't need for your particular add-on package.</li>
<li>Gettext translations must be placed into addon\locale\&lt;lang&gt;/LC_MESSAGES\nvda.po. </li>
</ul>
<h3>To manage documentation files for your addon:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Copy the <strong>readme.md</strong> file for your addon, and the <strong>docHandler.py</strong> file, contained into addonTemplate, to the first created folder, where you copied <strong>buildVars.py</strong>. You can also copy <strong>style.css</strong> to improve the presentation of HTML documents.</li>
<li>Documentation files (named <strong>readme.md</strong>) must be placed into addon\doc\&lt;lang&gt;/.</li>
<li>Don't use <strong>yourAddonName_docHandler.py</strong> as a name for any file contained in <strong>globalPlugins</strong>; it will be removed to create a menu item for opening your addon documentation, under NVDA's help menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: It's recommended to use hyphens instead of asterisks as tags for lists items, since they provide a better result when converting to HTML. You can also use asterisks followed by tab.</p>
<h3>To package the add-on for distribution:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open a command line, change to the folder that has the <strong>SCONSTRUCT</strong> file and run the <strong>scons</strong> command. The created add-on, if there were no errors, is placed in the current directory.</li>
<li>You can further customize variables in the <strong>buildVars.py</strong> file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this template only provides a basic add-on structure and build infrastructure. You may need to adapt it for your specific needs.</p>
<p>If you have any issues please use the NVDA addon list mensioned above.</p>
