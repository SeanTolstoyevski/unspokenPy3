## A few very important note!

**I am not the main developer of the addon.**

***

This add-on was running before the 2019.3 releases of NVDA.  
Developer was not developing the addon.

Afterwards, a Sudanese friend named Musharraf Omer built a new add-on by building the Audiothemes addon on Unspoken.  
Audiothemes have several problems.  
For example, some sounds crack.

Most of Unspoken is written in C.  
So it works faster and more stable against pure Python code.  
Audiothemes react relatively slowly.

I don't want to do  hurt the author of the add-on.  
Unspoken is a very important add-on for me.  
NVDA without it is bad ðŸ˜¢ .  
I wanted to open the source code to everyone.  
Please respect the great effort of the Unspoken main developer.

**Note**:

If you are not a developer, I wouldn't recommend running the add-on in beta.

## Issues that need help

I searched and couldn't find it.  
Feel free to create a PR for the problem.  
A very simple problem for experienced NVDA developers ðŸ¤—.
