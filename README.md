# A Bad News

I decided to quit this addon. Because I realized that I still cannot master the code source and system of NVDA.
NVDA is a very big project and when you want to produce something for NVDA, you have to master this resource.

What people wanted from me started to feel very difficult for me. This project was a work missed for 2019.3 and later version. I've seen this in many emails.
I have to examine the source of NVDA for a long time to be able to respond to people's requests. I have to research and mails.

There are other things to be done in matters I want to move in life.
I need to deal with topics such as C and Python C extensions, Golang, OpenAL-soft and games.
I want to release a game in 6 months. For this, I have to produce a new **audiogame tool**.
And I want to get a job. For this I will look for freelance jobs and try to find a company. All this is preventing me from following NVDA's changes, news and others.
There are many things I have to learn in order to get a job.

I reading philosophy books, technical books(mathematics, acoustics, physics) and other topic books. I'm 20 years old, now there are many ways and my head is very blurred. I become narrow in Turkey. I can not put effort into this project.

For this reason, I am archiving the project as of **September 16, 2020**.
But this does not mean that the project will end. This is a very simple project, it can always continue to be developed by someone else.

## Description
Unspoken deletes the **name label  of objects**. Different sounds are played instead of these names.  
Example: "more button", active Unspoken: "more (a unique sound)"  
This add-on can help you use your computer dynamic/faster.

## FEATURES:

- (default) **ctrl+shift+u**: Activates / deactivates Unspoken. You can use profiles to disable Unspoken in some applications.

(See: NVDA Menu>Input gestures...>Unspoken>... and NVDA Menu>Configuration profiles...)  
You can assign a different key here And you can create profiles for apps.  
**Note**: this is a new feature. Testing on more machines may be required. Please consider creating Issue. ( added Date: 31 Aug 2020)

## Issues that need help and Desired features
### ISSUES:
* Press NVDA+ctrl+f3  
	- after, the add-on don't run.

### Desired features:
* Themes
	- Users want to be able to switch between themes and customize sounds. Unfortunately, I don't have much time for this as I am interested in other projects. If you are a developer with plenty of time, you can create a PR for this feature.
