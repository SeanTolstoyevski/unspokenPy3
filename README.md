## description
Unspoken deletes the **name label  of objects**. Different sounds are played instead of these names.  
Example: "more button", active Unspoken: "more (a unique sound)"  
This add-on can help you use your computer dynamic/faster.

## FEATURES:

- (default) **ctrl+shift+u**: Activates / deactivates Unspoken. You can use profiles to disable Unspoken in some applications.

(See: NVDA Menu>Input gestures...>Unspoken>... and NVDA Menu>Configuration profiles...)  
You can assign a different key here And you can create profiles for apps.  
**Note**: this is a new feature. Testing on more machines may be required. Please consider creating Issue. ( added Date: 31 Aug 2020)

## A few very important note!
**I am not the main developer of the addon.**

***

This add-on was running before the 2019.3 releases of NVDA.  
Developer was not developing the addon.

Afterwards, a Sudanese friend named Musharraf Omer built a new add-on by building the Audiothemes addon on Unspoken.  
Audiothemes have several problems.  
For example, some sounds crack.

Most of Unspoken is written in C.  
So it works faster and more stable against pure Python code.  
Audiothemes react relatively slowly.

## Issues that need help and Desired features
### ISSUES:
* Press NVDA+ctrl+f3  
	- after, the add-on don't run.

### Desired features:
* Themes
	- Users want to be able to switch between themes and customize sounds. Unfortunately, I don't have much time for this as I am interested in other projects. If you are a developer with plenty of time, you can create a PR for this feature.
